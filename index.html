            “One day I was handed a few volumes of new literature unlike anything I had ever read before and so captivating as to
            make me utterly forget my hopeless state. They were the earlier works of Mark Twain and to them might have been due the
            miraculous recovery which followed. Twenty-five years later, when I met Mr. Clemens and we formed a friendship between
            us, I told him of the experience and was amazed to see that great man of laughter burst into tears.”
